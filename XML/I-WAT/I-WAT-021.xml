                            <handNote>The ogham inscription is both <rs type="execution" key="mixed">chiselled and pocked</rs>. The consonant strokes are pocked but vowel strokes appear to have been executed using a flat chisel and are wedge-shaped. With regard to spacing, there is no clear evidence of extra space between words or letters. The one exception is the extra space commonly used to distinguish between successive letters from the same <foreign xml:lang="ga">aicme</foreign> (here A and I). The spacing between individual strokes is in places uneven with, for example, more space between the strokes of the consonants (20-30mm) than between vowel strokes (15mm). This may, however, be due to roughness of the stone. The vowels strokes are short, approximately 10-15mm long and similarly wide. The few surviving consonant strokes are up to four times longer (40-50mm) and although many are damaged, they appear to be of average width (<width>5mm</width>). Macalister (1935, 150) notes that <q>some of the consonantal scores in this inscription give an impression that I have derived from other inscriptions that the engraver began by making a series of vowel-like notches upon the edge of the stone and then developed these into consonant scores as was required by the sense to be conveyed. There is a nick between the second and third scores of the V, which has no meaning - it may be a piece of faulty setting-out, stopped just after it had begun</q>.

Macalister (1945, 278; 1935, 150) recorded the ‘distal tip’ of a third stroke (preceeding the two) but this is not clear. Regarding the final I of a possible AVI, Macalister (1935, 150) describes it as <q>much worn, the first and third notches being effaced</q>.</note>

The vowel following M looks at first sight like O, but the second notch, on careful examination with a strong electric lamp, is seen to be an accidental fracture and the first notch is centrally placed between the M and the G. The G is quite clear, but a spall has carried off all but the butts of the following N-scores, so that a careless reader might take the letter for I. The final I is quite clear</q>.</note>

            <div type="commentary">
                <p>Since all other occurrences of AVI are preceded by an individual name and sometimes also by a patronym, it is very likely that this inscription must have originally also contained an individual name, which has been lost through damage to the stone.</p>
                <p>DAIMAGNI appears to be a formation with the individualising and hypo­coristic suffix *-<foreign>agno</foreign>- from a stem *<foreign>dai̯mo</foreign>- or *<foreign>dai̯mmo</foreign>-, a nominal stem that is otherwise unknown. Ziegler (1994, 163) compares the derivational basis of DAIMAGNI with that of the adjective <foreign xml:lang="ga">daimech</foreign> ‘with assent or consent; kind, friendly, affectionate’, for which she postul­ates the diphthong <foreign>áe/aí</foreign> on the basis of the com­parison with the name. However, this adjective, which was in­cluded in the original print edition of DIL, was derived from Peter O’Connell’s dic­tio­nary of Modern Irish; it has since been removed from eDIL. The entry <foreign xml:lang="ga">dáimeach</foreign> in Dinneen’s dictionary rather sug­gests the long monophthong <foreign>á</foreign>, and an adjectival formation from the noun <foreign xml:lang="ga">dám</foreign> ‘company, rela­tion­ship, affection’. It can there­fore not be used to illuminate the present name. Neither can her other comparison with the word <foreign>daim</foreign>, for which she quotes the old definition ‘free will’, but which in fact is just a form of the word <foreign>dom</foreign>, <foreign>dam</foreign> ‘house’ (LEIA D-9 <!--what is this?-->). Finally, Ziegler’s rough equation with the OIr. names <persName>Daimén</persName>, <persName>Daiméne</persName>, <persName>Daimíne</persName> etc. has to be rejected, since they are doubtless productively formed hypocoristics of the noun <foreign xml:lang="ga">dam</foreign> ‘ox, stag’. Ultimately, the etymo­logical analysis of DAIMAGNI must remain obscure. No population group of the name *<foreign>Uí Dáemáin</foreign> is known from the historic record.</p>
                <p>The retained genitive ending -I and the preserved -G- of the suffix are conservative features, but either could be due to orthographic, not phonetic conservativism.</p>
