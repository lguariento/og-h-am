Vowel notches are approximately <height>1-1.5cm</height> long, with roughly 1.5cm between them. Consonant strokes are <height>4-5cm</height> long with more like 3cm between the L/V and D strokes but 2cm between the G strokes and 1.7-2cm between the damaged N strokes. Macalister (1935, 150) notes that <q>'some of the consonantal scores in this inscription give an impression that I have derived from other inscriptions that the engraver began by making a series of vowel-like notches upon the edge of the stone and then developed these into consonant scores as was required by the sense to be conveyed. There is a nick between the second and third scores of the V, which has no meaning - it may be a piece of faulty setting-out, stopped just after it had begun'</q>.

                    <note>The beginning of the inscription is lost. The first visible signs are two strokes of the B-<foreign xml:lang="ga">aicme</foreign>, probably the remains of a V (3 strokes) and part of the formula word AVI. Macalister (1945, 278; 1935, 150) recorded the ‘distal tip’ of a third stroke (preceeding the two) but this is not clear. Regarding the final I of a possible AVI, Macalister (1935, 150) describes it as <q>'much worn, the first and third notches being effaced'</q>.</note>

The vowel following M looks at first sight like O, but the second notch, on careful examination with a strong electric lamp, is seen to be an accidental fracture and the first notch is centrally placed between the M and the G. The G is quite clear, but a spall has carried off all but the butts of the following N-scores, so that a careless reader might take the letter for I. The final I is quite clear'</q>.</note>

            <div type="commentary">
                <p>Since all other occurrences of AVI are preceded by an individual name and sometimes also by a patronym, it is very likely that this inscription must have originally also contained an individual name, which has been lost through damage to the stone.</p>
                <p>DAIMAGNI appears to be a formation with the individualising and hypo­coristic suffix *-<foreign>agno</foreign>- from a stem *<foreign>dai̯mo</foreign>- or *<foreign>dai̯mmo</foreign>-, a nominal stem that is otherwise unknown. Ziegler (1994: 163) compares the derivational basis of DAIMAGNI with that of the adjective <foreign xml:lang="ga">daimech</foreign> ‘with assent or consent; kind, friendly, affectionate’, for which she postul­ates the diphthong áe/aí on the basis of the com­parison with the name. However, this adjective, which was in­cluded in the original print edition of DIL, was derived from Peter O’Connell’s dic­tio­nary of Modern Irish; it has since been removed from eDIL. The entry <foreign xml:lang="ga">dáimeach</foreign> in Dinneen’s dictionary rather sug­gests the long monophthong á, and an adjectival formation from the noun <foreign xml:lang="ga">dám</foreign> ‘company, rela­tion­ship, affection’. It can there­fore not be used to illuminate the present name. Neither can her other comparison with the word <foreign>daim</foreign>, for which she quotes the old definition ‘free will’, but which in fact is just a form of the word <foreign>dom</foreign>, <foreign>dam</foreign> ‘house’ (LEIA D-9 <!--what is this?-->). Finally, Ziegler’s rough equation with the OIr. names <foreign>Daimén</foreign>, <foreign>Daiméne</foreign>, <foreign>Daimíne</foreign> etc. has to be rejected, since they are doubtless productively formed hypocoristics of the noun <foreign xml:lang="ga">dam</foreign> ‘ox, stag’. Ultimately, the etymo­logical analysis of DAIMAGNI must remain obscure. No population group of the name *<foreign>Uí Dáemáin</foreign> is known from the historic record.</p>
                <p>The retained genitive ending -I and the preserved -G- of the suffix are conservative features, but either could be due to orthographic, not phonetic conservativism.</p>
