However, it is noteworthy that the C, further on at a wider section of the stone, also stretches the entire width of this side of the stone in a manner very similar to that found on I-WAT-025, where the same stretching of scores the width of the stone occurs on the opposite B-<foreign xml:lang="ga">aicme</foreign>. This may suggest that the same person carved both.

Known locally as a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cill%C3%ADn">Cillín/killeen</ref>, a more recent geophysical survey has confirmed the existence of an <ref target="https://monasticon.celt.dias.ie/1720">ecclesiastical enclosure (Cill Ghruabháin)</ref>. The enclosure is bivallate (int. diam. c. 50m; ext. diam. c. 60m), perhaps with an annexe or secondary enclosure attached to the SE, which may be the arc represented on the <date>1927</date> map. A number of smaller circular features (diam. c. 10m) within the enclosure could represent hut-sites, or even the church (Purcell 2003, 6-8).

                <p>... son of *Cumcaide (?) from the sept of ...</p>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary">
                <p>Motta (1981, 135) proposes several comparisons. One is with the name COMOGANN (I-KER-012 = CIIC 145, Arraglen, Co. Kerry), COMMAGGAGNI (I-KER-131 = CIC 1083, Rathkenny, Co. Kerry), OIr. Comgán. However, that name goes back to *komago- ‘co-fighter’ + *-agno-. There is no way that the U of the first syllable could be explained by this analysis, let alone the -UGODU|U at the end, which would have to contain a different suffix. The comparisons with the names Cumma (a hypocoristically shortened name) and Cum­mascach ‘mixed, disturbed’ (earlier *kom-miskāko-) likewise lead nowhere for elucidating the present name. The only analyses that are formally able to account for CUMUGODU|U are a com­pari­son with OIr. <ref target="https://dil.ie/13837">cumcae</ref> ‘difficulty, strait’ (Ziegler 1994, 158) or with the verb <ref target="https://dil.ie/12189">con·ic</ref> ‘to be able, powerful’. Cumcae is the abstract of the adjective <ref target="https://dil.ie/13923">cumung</ref> ‘narrow’ (PrimIr. *kom-ingu-, PC *kom-angu-). Unexpectedly, cumcae has a [g] instead of the [ng] of the adjective; the lack of palatalisation of the middle cluster -mc- is also unclear. Formally, CUMUGODU|U could re­present /kuμəgodi̯a-/, i.e. a derivative with the productive OIr. adjectival suffix -dae (earlier *-odi̯o-) from this abstract cumcae. The meaning would be appro­ximately ‘the one characterised by nar­row­ness or difficulty’. In order to explain the spelling of the present form, it has to be assu­med that the vowel of the second syllable has already been reduced to a schwa, represented by U in this case. Alternatively, the name could be connected with the verb con·ic (PrimIr. *kom-igge/o-). The phonological analysis would be the same. Morphologically, the name would con­sist of the verbal stem *kuμig- (earlier *kom-igg-) + the adjec­tival suffix *-odi̯o-; its meaning would perhaps be ‘mighty, the one with power’. In either case, the name would appear as *Cumcaide in Old Irish, but no such name is attested to my know­ledge. Also in either case, it would be easiest to emend the final -U|U to -I, the genitive singular ending of a i̯o-stem. Adjectives in OIr. -dae are typically derived from nouns (Wodtko 1995: 224–289), which favours the con­nection with cumcae ‘difficulty, strait’, unless the derivational basis of the second op­tion is not the verbal stem *kom-igge/o-, but an otherwise unattested o-stem noun *kom-iggo- ‘power’ (for the formation, cf. OIr. comrac ‘encounter’, PrimIr. *kom-ro-iggo‑).</p>
                <p>The fragmentary state of the inscription renders it difficult to assess the value of the final vowels. If the foregoing etymological speculations are correct, the second syllable of the name would display reduction in its quality, pointing to the time shortly before or around the time of syncope in the mid-6th century.</p>
