                                <condition>A large irregularly shaped cave divided into two aisles by a rock buttress. The walls of the cave are full of natural fissures but also exhibit copious graffiti and carvings, including two ogham inscriptions. It is possible that letters have been lost from the beginning and end of the first inscription due to weathering (Forsyth 1996, 94-96).

                                <layout>The inscriptions are carved on the left-hand wall of the cave, about <height unit="m">2m</height> above the present floor. The area is also decorated with a panel of snake-like, loose spiral interlace graffiti (Forsyth 1996, 94-5). The first inscription is about <dim type="depth" unit="m">9m</dim> and the second is about <dim type="depth" unit="m">11m</dim> from the entrance gate. Regarding the damaged sections of the first inscription, there is room for at least 6 letters at the beginning but only a few would fit in the space at the end.

Immediately after the end of the upper patch there is a clear cross-stroke where the stem appears to end. There is a potential similar stroke below the lower patch, but not absolutely clear. These two end-strokes are about <dim type="length" unit="mm">500mm</dim> apart. Nothing is visible in the upper patch of wear, in the lower there may be traces of occasional strokes, but these are very faint (Forsyth 1996, 94). In the central portion, between the areas of wear there are a series of fairly clear strokes between <dim type="length" unit="mm">30 and 40mm</dim> long that are carefully carved and neatly spaced.       </handNote>

                <p>For the translation due to gaps caused by fissures and graffiti we only have <q>the last two letters of the first name and at most the first name of the second. The MEQ may represent OIr. <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/31166">maicc</ref></foreign> (gen. of macc) which means 'son'</q> (Forsyth 1996, 96).</p>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary">      
                <p>As Forsyth observed (1996, 97), if the inscription is as late as the eighth century, the -eo could be the genitival ending of an i-stem personal name, eg. Fedlimd, Fedlimtheo. Alternatively, it could be the end of the nominative of a name such as Reo, Buaidbeo or one of the compounds with second element Nia/Nio, such as Flaithnia and Maicnio.</p>
                <p>The inscription is an example of simple Type II inscriptions lacking the late features so they should be placed near the beginning of the Type II series. According to Forsyth, <q>At best this would offer a relative date, but since simple Type II ogham continued in use alongside more ambitious, formal varieties of the script, inscriptions using this form cannot be closely dated. They could be as early as the Pool ogham (sixth century) or later than Dunadd (late eighth century?)</q> (ibid. 99).</p>
                                <p>That the two ogham inscriptions, Blackwaterfoot 1 and Blackwaterfoot 2 (S-BUT-002), are contemporary with one another or with any other of the carvings in the cave cannot be proved (ibid. 95). However, it is clear that both are examples of casual graffiti.</p>
