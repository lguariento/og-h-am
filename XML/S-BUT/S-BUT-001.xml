                                <condition>A large irregularly shaped cave divided into two aisles by a rock buttress. There are opposing rows of small holes cut into the rock about 1 1/2-2m above the present floor which have been interpreted as sockets for small bars of wood (Forsyth 1996, 94). The walls of the cave are full of natural fissures but the south aisle of the cave also exhibits copious carvings and graffiti, including two ogham inscriptions (S-BUT-001 - S-BUT-002), an ogham text written in pigment (S-BUT-003), and what appears to be another ogham inscription but may be natural fissures (S-BUT-X01). <q>The condition of the stone does not rule out the possibility that letters have been lost from the beginning and the end of</q> the first inscription, Blackwaterfoot 1 (S-BUT-001) (Forsyth 1996, 96). The inscription is <q>apparently incomplete at both ends</q> (Fisher 2001, 66).

                                <layout>The south aisle of the cave is decorated with carvings of horses, deer, and concentric circles. The buttress bears a large and a small cross and the figure of a man with raised hands holding a curved object above his head. Towards the entrance, on the south wall there are two triangles and on the north wall of the south aisle there is a group of serpent-like spirals and four ogham inscriptions (Forsyth 1996, 94-5). The inscriptions are located on the left-hand wall of the cave, about <height unit="m">2m</height> above the present floor. The Blackwaterfoot 1 (S-BUT-001) inscription is <q>immediately left of the main group of serpents</q> about <dim type="depth" unit="m">9m</dim> from the entrance gate (Fisher 2001, 66). The stem-line is a curving crack of <q>natural origin</q> which runs vertically between two patches of wear, the lower <height unit="mm">260mm</height>, the upper <height unit="mm">84mm</height> (Fisher 2001, 66; Forsyth 1996, 95). Immediately after the end of the upper patch there is a clear cross-stroke where the natural stem appears to end. There is a potential similar stroke below the lower patch, but not absolutely clear. These two end-strokes are about <dim type="length" unit="mm">500mm</dim> apart. Nothing is visible in the upper patch of wear, in the lower there may be traces of occasional strokes, but these are very faint (Forsyth 1996, 94). The inscription is likely missing letters at both the beginning and the end, there is room for at least 6 letters at the beginning but only a few would fit in the space at the end.
                                    <!--To the right of the first inscription (S-BUT-001) and parallel with it, there appears to be another ogham inscription (S-BUT-003) but Jackson described it as <q>a piece of modern vandalism, not carved into the rock but drawn in pencil or ink</q> (Forsyth 1996, 95; Jackson 1973, 95). To the left of the first inscription, Forsyth also observed what appears <q>to be further ogham-like marking</q> (S-BUT-X01), however, these may <q>be natural fissures in the rock face with only a coincidental resemblance to ogham</q> (Forsyth 1996, 95). There is a second inscription (S-BUT-002) about <dim type="depth" unit="m">11m</dim> from the entrance gate.   -->

                        <provenance type="found" when="1968">Located in a sandstone cliff about 3km north of <placeName type="townland">Blackwaterfoot</placeName> are a series of caves of which the King's Cave at <placeName type="townland">Drumadoon (<foreign xml:lang="sga">Druim an DÃºin</foreign> 'ridge of the fort')</placeName> is the largest. The walls of the cave exhibit carvings which span from perhaps the Bronze Age to the present day. The animal and geometric carvings have been known since at least the end of the seventeenth century, but the presence of this ogham inscription was not noticed until about <date>1968</date> (Forsyth 1996, 94). Kenneth Steer first brought this ogham inscription to Kenneth Jackson's attention and arranged a trip to the cave to examine, measure, and draw the inscription in <date>September 1971</date> (Forsyth 1996, 94). Jackson published this ogham inscription in 1973 and also mentioned another possible ogham text written in pigment, Blackwaterfoot 3 (S-BUT-003), which is parallel to and to the right of this inscription. However, Jackson did not mention the Blackwaterfoot 4 (S-BUT-X01), the <q>ogham-like marking to the left</q> of this inscription, or the Blackwaterfoot 2 ogham inscriptions (Forsyth 1996, 95). The Blackwaterfoot 2 ogham inscription (S-BUT-002) was not discovered until <date>1992</date> when Ian Fisher of the RCAHMS conducted further survey work on the cave (ibid.).

                <p>As Forsyth observed (1996, 97), if the inscription is as late as the eighth century, the -eo could be the genitival ending of an i-stem personal name, eg. Fedlimd, Fedlimtheo. Alternatively, it could be the end of the nominative of a name such as Reo, Buaidbeo or one of the compounds with second element Nia/Nio, such as Flaithnia and Maicnio.</p>
                                <p>That the Blackwaterfoot 1 and Blackwaterfoot 2 (S-BUT-002) ogham inscriptions are contemporary with one another or with any other of the carvings in the cave cannot be proved (ibid. 95). However, it is clear that both are examples of casual graffiti.</p> 
                <p>According to Forsyth, the Blackwaterfoot inscriptions <q>could be as early as the Pool ogham (sixth century) or later than Dunadd (late eighth century?)</q> (ibid. 99).</p>
