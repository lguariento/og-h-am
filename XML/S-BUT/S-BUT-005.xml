The ogham inscription runs horizontally across the middle of the slate slab.

However there is not sufficient evidence to argue that the ogham inscription has not been added at a later date. The carver has managed to write the ogham in neatly parallel and equidistant individual strokes with the exception of the final stroke not reaching the stem. The care with which it was carved is consistent with it being a type of exercise. The letters of the H-group, as Forsyth and Tedeschi comment <q>exhibit a consistent forward slope, ie. their distal tips (furthest from the stem) are further forward (to the right) of their approximal tips</q> with letters of the B-group slope on this same axis (Lowe 2008, 139).

The same text is repeated on two lines, <q>albeit with different orthographic errors each time</q> (Lowe 2008, 137). The general inaccuracy of the writing and <q>the copying of the sentence on a second line</q>, indicates that this inscription was also a writing exercise (ibid., 138). Despite the difficulty of controlling the writing tool or the hardness and small size of the writing surface, the writer was able to <q>respect the Insular cursive minuscule model coherently</q> (ibid.). </handNote>
