                                <condition>A large irregularly shaped cave divided into two aisles by a rock buttress. There are opposing rows of small holes cut into the rock about 1 1/2-2m above the present floor which have been interpreted as sockets for small bars of wood (Forsyth 1996, 94). The walls of the cave are full of natural fissures but the south aisle of the cave also exhibits copious carvings and graffiti, including two ogham inscriptions (S-BUT-001 - S-BUT-002), an ogham text written in pigment (S-BUT-003), and what appears to be another ogham inscription but may be natural fissures (S-BUT-X01). Some natural fissures and a rough patch at the bottom potentially obscure the beginning of the Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription, no traces of any letters survive, and a protrubance at the top on the rock face may have served as a natural endpoint for the inscription (Forsyth 1996, 97-100). In and around the stem is a general hollowness which could be the result of water wear or chipping.

                                <layout style="stemline">The inscriptions are carved on the left-hand wall of the cave, about <height unit="m">2m</height> above the present floor. About 1.6m to the right of the Blackwaterfoot 1 inscription and about <depth unit="m">11m</depth> from the entrance of the cave is the Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription (S-BUT-002). The Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription has a near vertical stem-line which appears to be artificial. The stem-line <q>extends to the underside of an oblique overhang</q> and is about 300m long (Fisher 2001, 66). It is possible that the Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription might have commenced lower down, in the rough patch immediately before the start of the extant portion of the text. The inscription is unlikely to have extended higher because of a protrubance on the rock face (Forsyth 1996, 97). The stem leans slightly to the right <q>as if the upper part was getting beyond the reach of the carver</q>, suggesting that the inscription was intended to be read from the bottom upwards (ibid. 98). 
                                    <!--The first inscription (S-BUT-001) is about <dim type="depth" unit="m">9m</dim> from the entrance gate. To the right of the first inscription and parallel with it, there appears to be another ogham inscription (S-BUT-003) but Jackson described it as <q>a piece of modern vandalism, not carved into the rock but drawn in pencil or ink</q> (Forsyth 1996, 95; Jackson 1973, 95). To the left of the first inscription, Forsyth also observed what appears <q>to be further ogham-like marking</q> (S-BUT-X01), however, these may <q>be natural fissures in the rock face with only a coincidental resemblance to ogham</q> (Forsyth 1996, 95).-->

The strokes and letters are more widely spaced, less carefully parallel and of a more varied length than the Blackwaterfoot 1 inscription. Forsyth described the Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription as <q>less neat and compact than</q> the Blackwaterfoot 1 inscription (1996, 97). <q>The strokes appear V-shaped in section and are slashed across the surface of the rock. Some strokes, especially to the right of the stem, seem exceptionally long</q>, appearing to extend into the natural fissures (ibid.).

The walls of the cave exhibit carvings which span from perhaps the Bronze Age to the present day. The animal and geometric carvings have been known since at least the end of the seventeenth century, but the <name xml:id="S-BUT-001">Blackwaterfoot 1</name> (S-BUT-001) inscription was not noticed until about <date>1968</date> (Forsyth 1996, 94). Kenneth Steer first brought the Blackwaterfoot 1 ogham inscription to Kenneth Jackson's attention and arranged a trip to the cave to examine, measure, and draw the inscription in <date>September 1971</date> (Forsyth 1996, 94). Jackson published the Blackwaterfoot 1 ogham inscription in 1973 and also mentioned another possible ogham text written in pigment, Blackwaterfoot 3 (S-BUT-003), which is parallel to and to the right of Blackwaterfoot 1. However, Jackson did not mention this inscription, Blackwaterfoot 2 (S-BUT-002), or the Blackwaterfoot 4 (S-BUT-X01)  ogham inscription (Forsyth 1996, 95). Though only a short distance away from Blackwaterfoot 1, the <name xml:id="S-BUT-002">Blackwaterfoot 2</name> ogham inscription was not discovered until <date>1992</date> by Ian Fisher of the RCAHMS while conducting further survey work on the cave (Forsyth 1996, 94).

<p>The name Vuedla calls to mind the uidlua, 'wise woman, witch' from *wid which means 'to see, to know', of the famous Gualish inscription from Larzac. The Irish reflex (*widlma) appears as the name of the seeress Fedelm, in <title>Táin Bó Cuailgne</title>, and of a number of famous early Irish women, legendary and historical (Forsyth 1996, 99).</p>
                <p>That the Blackwaterfoot 1 (S-BUT-001) and Blackwaterfoot 2 ogham inscriptions are contemporary with one another or with any other of the carvings in the cave cannot be proved (ibid. 95). However, it is clear that both are examples of casual graffiti.</p> 
                        <p>According to Forsyth, the Blackwaterfoot inscriptions <q>could be as early as the Pool ogham (sixth century) or later than Dunadd (late eighth century?)</q> (ibid. 99).</p>
