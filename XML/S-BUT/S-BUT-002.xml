                                <condition>A large irregularly shaped cave divided into two aisles by a rock buttress. The walls of the cave are full of natural fissures but also exhibit copious graffiti and carvings, including two ogham inscriptions. Some natural fissures and a rough patch at the bottom  potentially obscure the beginning of the second inscription, no traces of any letters survive, and a protrubance at the top on the rock face may have served as a natural endpoint for the inscription (Forsyth 1996, 97-100). In and around the stem is a general hollowness which could be the result of water wear or chipping.

                                <layout>The inscriptions are carved on the left-hand wall of the cave, about <height unit="m">2m</height> above the present floor. The area is also decorated with a panel of snake-like, loose spiral interlace graffiti (Forsyth 1996, 94-5). At a similar height to the first inscription (S-BUT-001) is the second inscription which is about <depth unit="m">11 m</depth> from the entrance of the cave. It is possible that the inscription might have commenced lower down, in the rough patch immediately before the start of the extant portion of the text. The inscription is unlikely to have extended higher because of a protrubance on the rock face (ibid. 97). The stem leans slightly to the right <q>as if the upper part was getting beyond the reach of the carver</q>, suggesting that the inscription was intended to be read from the bottom upwards (ibid. 98).

The strokes and letters are more widely spaced, less carefully parallel and of a more varied length than the first inscription. <q>The strokes appear V-shaped in section and are slashed across the surface of the rock. Some strokes, especially to the right of the stem, seem exceptionally long</q>, appearing to extend into the natural fissures (Forsyth 1996, 97).

The divergence of the second stroke to the first letter raises the possibility that this group of three strokes is meant to be interpreted as two letters from the same aicme, B and L, which would yield the following reading:</note>

                <p>The name Vuedla calls to mind the uidlua, 'wise woman, witch' from *wid which means 'to see, to know', of the famous Gualish inscription from Larzac (Forsyth 1996, 99).</p>

<p>The Irish reflex (*widlma) appears as the name of the seeress Fedelm, in<title> TÃ¡in BÃ³ Cuailgne</title>, and of a number of famous early Irish women, legendary and historical (Forsyth 1996, 99).</p>
                        <p>The inscription is an example of simple Type II inscriptions lacking the late features so they should be placed near the beginning of the Type II series. According to Forsyth, <q>At best this would offer a relative date, but since simple Type II ogham continued in use alongside more ambitious, formal varieties of the script, inscriptions using this form cannot be closely dated. They could be as early as the Pool ogham (sixth century) or later than Dunadd (late eighth century?)</q> (ibid. 99).</p>
                <p>That the two ogham inscriptions, Blackwaterfoot 1 (S-BUT-001) and Blackwaterfoot 2, are contemporary with one another or with any other of the carvings in the cave cannot be proved (ibid. 95). However, it is clear that both are examples of casual graffiti.</p>
