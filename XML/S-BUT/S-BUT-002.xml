                                <condition>A large irregularly shaped cave divided into two aisles by a rock buttress. There are opposing rows of small holes cut into the rock about 1 1/2-2m above the present floor which have been interpreted as sockets for small bars of wood (Forsyth 1996, 94). The walls of the cave are full of natural fissures but the south aisle of the cave also exhibits two ogham inscriptions (S-BUT-001 - S-BUT-002), an ogham text written in pigment (S-BUT-003), and what appears to be another ogham inscription but may be natural fissures (S-BUT-X01). Some natural fissures and a rough patch at the bottom potentially obscure the beginning of the Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription, no traces of any letters survive, and a protrubance at the top on the rock face may have served as a natural endpoint for the inscription (Forsyth 1996, 97-100). In and around the stem is a general hollowness which could be the result of water wear or chipping.

The Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription (S-BUT-002) is about 1.6m to the right of the Blackwaterfoot 1 inscription and about <depth unit="m">11m</depth> from the entrance of the cave. The Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription has a near vertical stem-line which appears to be artificial. The stem-line <q>extends to the underside of an oblique overhang</q> and is about 300m long (Fisher 2001, 66). It is possible that the Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription might have commenced lower down, in the rough patch immediately before the start of the extant portion of the text. The inscription is unlikely to have extended higher because of a protrubance on the rock face (Forsyth 1996, 97). The stem leans slightly to the right <q>as if the upper part was getting beyond the reach of the carver</q>, suggesting that the inscription was intended to be read from the bottom upwards (ibid. 98).

The strokes and letters are more widely spaced, less carefully parallel and of a more varied length than the Blackwaterfoot 1 inscription. Forsyth described the Blackwaterfoot 2 inscription as <q>less neat and compact than</q> the Blackwaterfoot 1 inscription (1996, 97). <q>The strokes appear V-shaped in section and are slashed across the surface of the rock. Some strokes, especially to the right of the stem, seem exceptionally long</q>, appearing to extend into the natural fissures (ibid.).

Kenneth Steer and Kenneth Jackson had previously visited the cave in <date>September 1971</date> to examine, measure, and draw the Blackwater 1 (S-BUT-001) inscription, but the Blackwater 2 (S-BUT-002) inscription went unnoticed even though it is only a short distance away from the Blackwaterfoot 1 (S-BUT-001) inscription. Jackson does not mention the Blackwater 2 (S-BUT-002) inscription in his 1973 publication, nor does he mention the Blackwaterfoot 4 (S-BUT-X01) ogham inscription, however, he does mention another possible ogham text written in pigment, Blackwaterfoot 3 (S-BUT-003), which is parallel to and to the right of Blackwaterfoot 1.

<p>The name Vuedla calls to mind the uidlua, 'wise woman, witch' from *<foreign xml:lang="xtg">wid</foreign> which means 'to see, to know', of the famous Gaulish inscription from Larzac. The Irish reflex (*<foreign xml:lang="sga">widlma</foreign>) appears as the name of the seeress <persName xml:lang="sga">Fedelm</persName>, in <title>TÃ¡in BÃ³ Cuailgne</title>, and of a number of famous early Irish women, legendary and historical (Forsyth 1996, 99).</p>
                <p>That the Blackwaterfoot 1 (S-BUT-001) and Blackwaterfoot 2 ogham inscriptions are contemporary with one another or with any other of the carvings in the cave cannot be proved (ibid. 95). However, it is clear that both are examples of casual graffiti.</p> 
                        <p>According to Forsyth, the Blackwaterfoot inscriptions <q>could be as early as the Pool ogham (sixth century) or later than Dunadd (late eighth century?)</q> (ibid. 99).</p>
