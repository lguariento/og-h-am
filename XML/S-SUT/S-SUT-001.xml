A deeply-cut line has been incised about 35-40mm from the vertical arris on either side. This has created
the impression that the ogham inscription occupies a slightly raised roll-moulding. </layout>

                        <note>The inscription seems to follow the 'X MAQQ Y' formula and likely contains personal names (Forsyth 1996, 317). The presence of MAQQ or MEQQ gives a clear indication as to preliminary word division. However, the sections both before and after the MAQQ or MEQQ are rather long and may require further word division. Although, most authorities are agreed in taking ALLHHALLORREDD as a separate word. </note>

                <p>An exact interpretation of the text has not been determined, but possible interpretations include: 'the monument of Alored son of the nephew of Fercar' or 'the monument of Alored, MacNia, and Fercar'.</p>

            <div type="commentary">
                <p>The final two syllables of ALLHHALLORREDD, -orredd (-ored), may be compared with the common Brittonic male personal element <foreign xml:lang="cel">-gwared (guored, uoret)</foreign>, meaning 'protection, bulwark, defense' attested in Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. The first syllable, ALL, might be meant to be read as the Irish word <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/954">ail</ref></foreign>, meaning 'rock, boulder, grave-stone, monument'. Within this context, the following word would be a personal name in the genitive.</p>
                <p>MAQQ OR MEQQ is interpreted as an attempt to render the genitive <foreign xml:lang="sga">maicc</foreign>, meaning 'son'. NIA, <foreign xml:lang="sga">nia</foreign>, which is also Irish has two possible meanings, 'warrior, champion' and 'sister's son'.</p>
                <p>The final section of the text VARRC[.]RR, might be transliterated as FARRCARR which may be a form of the Irish male personal name <persName xml:lang="sga">Ferchar</persName>, a compound of the elements <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/21665">fer</ref></foreign> 'man' and <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/8202">cha(i)r</ref></foreign> 'loving', meaning 'friendly'.</p>
                <p>The three names at Golspie could be three individuals commemorated equally, or the name of the patron (secular), patron (ecclesiastical), and craftsman, as is found on later Irish crosses such as the Cross of the Scriptures at Clonmacnoise [CIIC 849] or the Market Cross at Tuam [CIIC 523].</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting features of the Golspie ogham is that it is written without drawn-in stem-line on the arris of the stone. While this is the norm on otherwise undressed and uncarved pillars, it is unique on a highly decorated cross-slab. Since Golspie cannot be as early as the seventh century and is probably no earlier than the middle of the eighth, this is an important reminder that the lack of a stem-line is not necessarily indicative of an early date (Forsyth 1996, 312).</p>
