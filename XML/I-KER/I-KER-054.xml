Above the circle and joined to it by a small stem is a scrolled crest. Beneath the circle and separate from it is an elaborate design ending in a pelta motif. The design comprises a sunken field of inverted triangular shape with a concave upper edge. A short stem issues from its lower apex. At the left and right apices is a large incised oval with a pendant `string' looping to the outer edge of the stone. Also pendant from each apex is a line which runs down to form the pelta. In addition, two short lines curve upwards and outwards from the right oval towards the edge of the stone</q> (Okasha and Forsyth 2001, 162).</desc>

The direction of the text is uncertain but it has tentatively been read upwards. As pointed out by Macalister (1937, 225), the strokes almost reach the whole width of this side but the inscription is probably up the left side of the uninscribed face rather than the right side of the inscribed face.</layout> 
                                <layout n="2">This is one of only two (or possibly three) biscriptal inspritions from Ireland, whereas biscriptial and bilingual inscriptions are very common in SW Britain. The Latin-letter inscription on this stone (also vertical) is beneath the cross design on the face, reading upwards with the bases of the letters to the viewer's right. Macalister (1945, 179-180) read a preceeding line of text, parallel to the surviving line but reading in the opposite direction (downwards with the basses to the left). There are traces of what may have been lettering here but nothing is now legible (Okasha and Forsyth 2001, 162).</layout>

The strokes of the Q are more tightly spaced than the other consonant(s).</handNote>
                            <handNote n="2">The inscription on the face is in Latin half-uncial script and, like the cross design, is cut rather than pocked. The letters vary in size with the uncial E noticably larger (<height unit="mm">75mm</height>) than the other letters (Okasha and Forsyth 2001, 162). The Ns are quite slender and the T is curved. Only a single stroke remains of what was reasonably read by Macalister as an F. According to Macalister (1945, 179-180), the first line read downwards and the F was carved horizontally rather than vertically <q>as though to form a pivot on which the two lines of the inscription hinge</q>.

                <p>The ogham and roman alphabet inscriptions appear to be unrelated and the two do not impinge on one another. While it is impossible to be certain, it would seem that an ogham stone was later re-purposed as an inscribed cross-slab (Okasha and Forsyth 2001, 163-164).</p>
                <p>The form of the cross design has many parallels on the Dingle and Iveragh Peninsulas, assigned by Henry (1937, 279) to the sixth and seventh centuries.</p>
                <p><q>The spelling <persName xml:lang="sga">Finten</persName> for the later <persName xml:lang="ga">Fintan</persName> is consevative and implies a comparatively early date, perhaps seventh or early-eighth century... While it is possible that a later reading of the text may have inspired the dedication of Kilfountan/Cill Fionntain, it is more likely that the text is a dedicatory one, recording the donation or dedication of the site to the eponymous saint, although to which of the many St Fintans is not known</q> (Okasha and Forsyth 2001, 163-164).</p>
