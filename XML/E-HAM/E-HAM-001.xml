                                <condition>A Roman column bearing a two-line ogham inscription. Described by Macalister (1945, 473) as <q>"like the finial of a large balustrade"</q>, the cone-shaped pillar widens upwards and narrows towards the top. The top of the pillar has broken off, damaging the inscription, particularly, at the end of the first name, the beginning of the second line, as well as the latter portion of the ogham text. However, Macalister (1945, 473) maintained that <q>"there can be no doubt whatever about the reading, so far as it is preserved"</q>. The stone was repurposed as a memorial by an Irish family which <q>"may have settled on the site in the post-Roman interval"</q> (Macalister 1945, 475).</condition>

                        <note>The name <foreign xml:lang="">Tebicatos</foreign> appears to be British (Brythonic) rather than Irish (Goidelic). Although the initial element Teb- is of uncertain meaning, it is paralleled in the name of <foreign>Tibatto</foreign>, leader of the Bacaudae in Farther Gaul, who led a rebellion in 435-437; and it may also be related to the medial element in the names <foreign>Vortipor</foreign> and <foreign>Votiporigis</foreign>. The final element <foreign>-catos</foreign> means 'battle" (Old Irish <foreign>cath</foreign>, Old Welsh <foreign>cat</foreign>), and is attested in names such as <foreign>Ambicatos</foreign> 'having battle around himself', son of <foreign>Rocatos</foreign> (ANDRS/1), and <foreign>Ambigatos</foreign>, king of the Bituriges in central Gaul. Perhaps <foreign>Tebicatos</foreign> was an Irish immigrant who adopted a British name (or Brythonifed his original name) or perhaps he was the member of an Irish family who was born in Silchester and so had a British name (Babelstone 2009, "Ogham Stones of Elsewhere").</note>

                <p>Macalister noted that the inscription is <q>"not a mere graffito: the formal statement of the name in the genitive case links it to the rest of the Ogham sepulchral literature"</q> (1945, 473). Additionally, Macalister ascertained that <q>"the date of the stone cannot be fixed by the objects which were in association with it"</q> (1945, 475). However, a <q>"re-excavation of the site in 1998-2000 unearthed some fragments of oak at the bottom of the well, which have been radiocarbon-dated to 130-380 and 320-540, giving a probable date for the closing of the well of about 350-425. Archaeologists working on the Silchester site believe that the depositing of the Ogham-inscribed stone in the well marked both the sealing of the well, and the end of occupation of the associated building. They further suggest that the stone was used as a mark of ownership of the associated late Roman dwelling by an Irish immigrant named Tebicatos"</q> (Babelstone 2009, "Ogham Stones of Elsewhere").</p>
