                                <condition>The knife-handle retains only the rusted tang of an iron blade. The bone is well preserved apart from a fracture near the blade-end (Forsyth 1996, 58). The ogham inscription is generally clear and appears complete. Parts of the inscription have been worn or chipped and vowel-notches have been lost, however, Forsyth (1996, 59) notes that <q>the available space may be used to determine what is missing</q>. </condition>

The individual strokes appear to have been closely yet evenly spaced and there is clear differentiation between vowels and consonants.</layout>

                    <note>The use of RTI and photogrammetry conducted by Megan Kasten has confirmed the reading provided as the most feasible. The measurements taken from the 3D model enabled a more precise estimation of the average spacing between individual letters and therefore suggest that the second letter is most likely to be an O (two strokes). Similarly, given the space between the third to last and the last letter, and considering what is left of the damaged surface, the second to last character is most likely to have been an A or a B with A being linguistically more probable (Kasten 2023).</note>

                        <note>Forsyth (1996, 61) highlights two features of the inscription that are worth mentioning: <q>the initial letter, M, is upright, not oblique</q> and there are no double letters in the inscription. Furthermore, although previous commentators have interpreted the Bac Mhic Connain ogham as Pictish, Forsyth (1996, 66) maintains that <q>the letters are most naturally read as Irish</q>. </note>

<p>Forsyth (1996, 66) maintains that, generally, <q>the text appears to be a single male personal name and as such probably records the identity of the owner or maker (or donor if it was given as a gift)</q>.</p>
<p>Forsyth highlights that <q>the Bac Mhic Connain knife-handle is one of a very small group of ogham-inscribed household objects, and as such provides important evidence for the non-monumental use of the script</q>, signifying <q>ogham literacy at a non-church-site, on the part of people of middling social standing</q> (Forsyth 1996, 65).</p>
