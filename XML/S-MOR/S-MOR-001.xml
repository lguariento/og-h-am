                                <condition>The ogham inscriptions are severely damaged with only short sections being legible (Forsyth 1996, 142). A broad recessed band cut along the top edge carries away the end of both lines of ogham on the back face. Traces of ogham letters are visible along the entire extant length of the right margin of the reverse face, however, on the left margin letters are only visible as far as the curl of the monster's tail. Thereafter the surface is too worn to tell and the final quarter of its length has flaked away entirely. On the front of the slab ogham is visible on the right margin only. The front face is badly weathered, the carving on the reverse is in good condition (Forsyth 1996, 142). The lower edge of the slab is broken with a portion missing from the back (Forsyth 1996, 142).</condition>

An incised stem-line runs up the centre of each band (Forsyth 1996, 145). The direction of the angled vowels and the slope of the b- and h- <foreign xml:lang="ga">aicme</foreign> consonants indicate that the three inscriptions are to be read vertically upwards.</layout>

The strokes are of no more than medium length and the vowel strokes are long, occupying the entire width of the raised band (Forsyth 1996, 155). There are occasional angled-vowels with one case of what appears to be a mix of straight and angled strokes (Forsyth 1996, 155). Individual letters are carefully spaced and component strokes are parallel and evenly-spaced (Forsyth 1996, 155).

                <p>The Brodie ogham is by far the longest ogham inscription from Scotland, originally consisting of up to seventy or eighty characters, and represents a substantial commitment to ogham literacy (Forsyth 1996, 157-158).</p>    
                <p>Given the length of the inscription combined with the fact that the typical 'MAQQ' does not seem to appear at any point, it is likely the original text incorporated more than proper nouns (Forsyth 1996, 157-158). Only one section, the EDDARRNONN on the back left representing the male personal name <persName xml:lang="cel">Etheman/ldamon</persName>, can be established with certainty (ibid). Though the name is Brittonic, the spelling could be Irish or Pictish (Forsyth 1996, 157-158).</p>
                <p>The fact that the Brodie Stone has been carefully dressed and all its carvings, apart from the ogham inscription, are in relatively high relief suggests a date later in the Pictish period (Forsyth 1996, 142).</p>
