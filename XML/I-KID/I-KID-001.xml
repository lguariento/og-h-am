                                <condition>This rough, rectangular pillar (greywacke, with quartz veining) is somewhat battered and weathered, including some damage to the roman-letter inscription on one of the faces. The ogham, though weathered, is mostly legible. There is also modern graffiti in the form of initials (JM) scratched onto the face to the right of the third V of the roman-letter inscription. The height initially recorded by Shearman (1864, 254) was 6 feet 4 inches (1.90m) but only 1.54m are currently accessible above the display case. </condition>

                                <layout n="2">The roman-letter inscription starts just a few centimetres above the ogham on the face to the left and also runs upwards (facing right) to near the top of the stone.

However, as noted in a number of other ogham inscriptions, the distinctive vowels appear to be wedge-shaped (with flat sides) and may have been cut using a flat chisel. The ogham strokes in this inscription are well spaced out except for the final S of the first name where the strokes are slightly closer together to avoid a ridge on the stone. The consonant strokes are quite long, for example the N and S of the first name (up to <height unit="mm">132</height>mm in length), which are also quite slanted and more slender (c. <width unit="mm">5</width>mm) than, for instance, the final S (<height unit="mm">83</height>mm long and <width unit="mm">10</width>mm wide). The wedge-shaped vowels are approximately <height unit="mm">15</height> x <width unit="mm">10</width>mm.</handNote>
                           <handNote n="2">Although there are many examples of inscriptions in roman letters in Ireland, most are later and in insular half-uncial (even the early, c.6th-century, Inchagoill pillar). Only this one is entirely in roman capitals and so has more in common with British examples. Noteworthy features include the upward reading layout (typically downwards in British examples), the reversed S and possibly ligatured NE.

                        <provenance type="found" when="1860">Discovered just inside the gate of the graveyard at <ref target="https://monasticon.celt.dias.ie/4129">Cillín Chormaic</ref> (beside the figure-carved pillar described below) by Rev. John F. Shearman in 1860 and reported to members of the Royal Irish Academy in 1865 (Shearman 1864-1866, 253-260). Seven ogham stones (or fragments) in total were found at this site, one of which (I-KID-002 Colbinstown 2) seems to have been broken up and at least one fragment re-used in the repair of the surrounding wall in the late 19th century (FitzGerald 1895, 380-2). This is the largest collection of ogham stones found at a single site in Leinster. Four complete ogham stones and two fragments survive today. A geophysical survey carried out in the surrounding fields in 2012 revealed traces of a trivallate enclosure (max. diam. 205m) surrounding the burial ground, which occupies the centre of a much more extensive early medieval ecclesiastical site (Greene 2013, 37-40). In addition to the ogham stones, a number of other notable monuments (some of granite) have also been discovered at the site, including numerous (uninscribed) pillar stones and three probable cross slabs (Greene 2013, 33-36; Macalister and Praeger 1928-9, 253-61). One of the pillar stones (KD032-044016-), a slender earthfast stone (H 1.3m; L 0.35m N-S; Wth 0.25m), which this ogham stone was found standing beside, has a lightly carved bust on the upper N face: a head, with a very pointed chin, is shown with a possible hooded-cloak and the figure carries a cross over its left shoulder.

                <p>As usual, there is no word division in the roman-letter inscription. In the ogham inscription, however, there is extra space between before and after the second word AVI. In the case of the latter, this is necessary to distinguish between the final I of the second word and the initial I of the third. Word division is not generally a feature of classical ogham but a few possible examples of extra space following the intial name have been observed (e.g. I-COR-069 Monataggart 1, Co. Cork, see Moffat ).</p>
