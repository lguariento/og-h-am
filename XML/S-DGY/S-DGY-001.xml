                                    <p>The fragment is described by Forsyth as being <q>'Poor, fragmentary, surface severely abraded</q> (1996,519). There appears to be a lot of decay on the surface of the stone with portions broken off, especially at the right and back face of it which is too damaged to discern if any carvings where there initially. The surfaces that have been incised are also worn suggesting exposure to the elements before being buried.</p>

                                    <p>As one fragment of the five-sided pillar, the stone's faces are home to some, questionable, ogham inscriptions on its front face, while the left-hand face has some incised lines that appear to be artificial, yet their form, origin and purpose remain unknown.</p>

                                <p>Due to the condition of the fragmentary stone, there is speculation on the authenticity and validity of the inscriptions being of the ogham alphabet altogether. It is impossible to know how long the stem, which has been drawn-in, was originally, but currently as it stands it is <dim type="lenght" unit="m">0.390</dim> long. Forsyth, based on the clearer patches on the stone argues that the incisions where deeper, and that <q>'when first cut, the lines had a broad, V-shaped section</q> (1996, 521). A detailed description by Forsyth follows:

                        <p>According to Forsyth, the inscriptions on the left-hand face of the fragmentary stone could belong to any period with no indication as to whether they are contemporary with each-other or with the ogham ones on the front-face (1996, 519)</p>
                    </item>
                     <item n="2">
                         <p>There are gaps between each ogham stroke ranging from <dim type="length" unit="m">0.025-0.080</dim> which is unclear weather other ogham strokes used to be there or if the gaps where intentional. Forsyth however notes that <q>'The inscription, however, is so short and 
fragmented that it would be unwise to make too much of the spacing between strokes'</q> (1996,522).</p>
                     </item>
                     <item n="3">
                         <p>Taken as ogham text, the inscription should be read from bottom up, however Forsyth warns there is no way to know that its present position is its original, and the stone could potentially have been stood the other way around.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item n="4">
                         <p>The form of the ogham carvings proves problematic in identifying the inscription as ogham in general. Forsyth through comparison with other Scottish ogham comments that the backwards slope of the long oblique strokes is opposite to the usual forward slope of the strokes on other inscriptions found in Scotland (1996,522). </p>
                     </item>
                     <item n="5">
                         <p>Another issue that arises with the form is the use of both short perpendicular and short oblique strokes which otherwise one of the two is usually used. When both are in use, Forsyth comments, oghamists <q>'rarely differentiate so sharply between the two kinds, but rather have strokes which slope either a little or not at all'</q> (1996,523). As such if the lines are ogham, the oghamist <q>'was either innovative or inept'</q> (ibid.,524).</p>

                         <p>Despite speculation however, the <name xml:id="S-DGY-001">Lochnaw</name> stone has some parallels, in terms of its morphology, located in Scotland on the same western, northern seaboard it is found. Moreover, Lochnaw is, according to Forsyth <q>'well placed to participate cultural dissemination along the sea routes between Ireland, Mann and the west Coast of Scotland'</q> (1996,524).</p>
