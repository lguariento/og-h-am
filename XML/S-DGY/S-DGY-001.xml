                                <condition>The stone is a fragment of an irregular five-sided pillar which is in poor condition with a severely abraded surface (1996, 519). There appears to be a lot of decay on the surface of the stone with portions broken off, especially at the right and back face of it which is too damaged to discern if any carvings where there initially. The surfaces that have been incised are also worn suggesting exposure to the elements before being buried.

                                <layout style="vertical" rend="stemline_up">According to Forsyth (1996, 524), the lack of a defined edge on the pillar may have dictated the choice of face rather than arris for the inscription. The face of the fragment is home to some questionable ogham letters. It is impossible to know how long the stem was originally. As it stands, the drawn-in stemline is <dim type="length" unit="m">0.390</dim>m long. There are gaps between each ogham stroke ranging from <dim type="length" unit="m">0.025-0.080</dim>m and it is unclear whether other ogham strokes used to be there or if the gaps where intentional. Forsyth (1996, 522) notes that the <q>inscription, however, is so short and fragmented that it would be unwise to make too much of the spacing between strokes</q>.

                            <handNote>An examination of the clearer patches on the stone suggests that the incisions were deeper, and that <q>when first cut, the lines had a broad, V-shaped section</q>, indicating that the inscription was <rs type="execution" key="chiselled" ref="https://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/writing/lod/203.html">v-cut</rs> (Forsyth 1996, 521). The first letter consists of a long stroke of <dim type="length" unit="m">0.080</dim> perpendicularly across the stem. The second letter is a short stroke of <dim type="length" unit="m">0.045</dim> to the left of and perpendicular to the stem. The third letter is a long stroke of <dim type="length" unit="m">0.110</dim> obliquely across the stem-line, sloping backwards. The fourth letter is a long stroke of <dim type="length" unit="m">0.110</dim> running parallel with 3. The fifth letter is a short stroke of <dim type="length" unit="m">0.090</dim> to the left of the stem, parallel with 3 and 4. The sixth letter is a short stroke of <dim type="length" unit="m">0.080</dim> to the left of and perpendicular to the stem. The seventh letter is a short stroke of <dim type="length" unit="m">0.070</dim> to the left of and perpendicular to the stem (1996, 521).

                        <note>There is no way to know that the present position of the stone is its original, the stone could potentially have been stood the other way around.

                    <note>The authenticity and validity of the ogham inscription is still the subject of speculation. Although the inscription gives an initial impression of being ogham, the lack of vowel strokes and the direction of some of the oblique strokes are more serious objections than the real difficulty in determining a reading. Forsyth (1996, 522) maintains that the backwards slope of the long oblique strokes is opposite to the usual forward slope of the strokes on other ogham inscriptions found in Scotland.</note>

                        <note>Another issue that arises with the form is the use of both short perpendicular and short oblique strokes which otherwise one of the two is usually used. When both are in use, Forsyth (1996, 523) comments, oghamists <q>rarely differentiate so sharply between the two kinds, but rather have strokes which slope either a little or not at all</q>. As such if the lines are ogham, the oghamist <q>was either innovative or inept</q> (ibid., 524).</note></app>
