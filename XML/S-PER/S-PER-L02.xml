                                <condition>A small stone incised with designs, a letter, and an ogham inscription. The stone appears to have <q>been tampered with in modern times</q> (Southesk 1895, 244). Southesk maintained that the <q>lines have unquestionably been more or less lately retouched with hard instruments</q> (ibid. 247). Consequently, <q>doubt is cast upon the whole</q> as the fresh whiteness of the lines could indicate that the marks are modern and that the inscription is perhaps fabricated (ibid.). Additionally, the right edge of the stone is <q>overgrown with short green moss</q> which may hint that that part of the stone <q>must have been not long ago exposed to the air</q>. As Southesk reasoned, <q>such vegetation could not exist on a stone that had been buried for centuries</q> (ibid. 247).

                    <note>The inscription contains marks which are difficult to interpret. At the beginning of the inscription a mark consisting of a semi-circle containing three dots is present below the stem and the same mark appears as well above the stem, slightly overlapping with the first letter (Forsyth 1996, 504).

                        <note>A similar mark, a semi-circle containing a single dot, also occurs above the stem at the seventh character (ibid. 505). Underneath this character, is a short horizontal line with three angled strokes which is incised <q>to the right of and parallel with the stem</q> and meets the first stroke of the eighth letter to the right of the stem (ibid.).

                        <note>According to Forsyth, the angled E could possibly be alternatively read as the letter sequence letter sequence AHBHA. The orientation of the strokes is as follows: <q>four short strokes to the left of the stem sloping slightly forward, above three short strokes to the right of the stem sloping slightly forward. The first and last strokes of each group meet at the stem to form a vowel stroke. The third of the right hand strokes meets the stem equidistant between the middle pair of the left hand strokes</q> (1996, 505). As Forsyth stated, if <q>a fourth stroke to the right has not been omitted, these could be read as AHBHA, otherwise E</q> (ibid.). This sequence of strokes is followed by a <q>single dot to the left of the stem</q> (ibid.).</note>
