                                    <p>This ogham-inscribed fragment has been severely cut down and potentially represents only a small portion of the original cross slab and inscription. There are no signs which might indicate the original proportions of either. The upper half of the fragment is especially damaged, obscuring the area containing the carving of a <rs type="decoration">horse or deer</rs> of which only two legs, facing left, now survive. Similarly, a semi-circular portion of the bottom left corner of the fragment <q>has been deliberately defaced</q> (Forsyth 1996, 5). Three complete letters of the original inscription survive on the fragment, the carving is clear and well-preserved (ibid. 4).</p>

                                    <p>The upper section of the fragment features the remains of a common Pictish sculpture symbol, the <rs type="decoration">high-stepping horse(s)</rs> (Forsyth 1996, 5). The ogham text is positioned below the symbol carving on a <q>broad raised band</q> which is <dim type="breadth" unit="mm">90mm</dim> broad and occupies the full width of the fragment  (ibid. 5). The stem-line is <dim type="length" unit="mm">225mm</dim> in length and extends beyond the strokes of the outermost letters, indicating that the inscription <q>extended further in both directions</q> (ibid. 7). Forsyth theorises that <q>if the Abernethy was part of the upper face of a recumbent...then an ogham inscription which began in the bottom left-hand corner, rose vertically...continued across the top, down the right-hand side and along the bottom would have the portion under the horses hooves reading forward right-to-left</q> (ibid. 7). </p>

                            <handNote>The individual strokes are deep U-section grooves that have been initially <rs type="execution"  key="pocked" ref="https://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/writing/lod/11.html">pocked</rs> and then smoothed out. The spacing of the extant letters is irregular and uneven although, as Forsyth cautions, it would be unwise to make an assesment on the spacing of the entire inscription on this basis as there is insufficient evidence surviving from the fragment. The first letter is comprised of five short oblique strokes to the left of the stem, with the individual strokes ranging from <dim type="length" unit="mm">35-40mm</dim> in length, and even spacing between strokes of <width unit="mm">65mm</width> in width. The second letter is one long stroke across the stem, <dim type="length" unit="mm">50mm</dim> in length, sloping forwards. The third letter consists of five long strokes, bound and perpendicular across the stem. The individual strokes measure <dim type="length" unit="mm">52mm</dim> in length, with even spacing amounting to a total width of <width unit="mm">55mm</width>.

                        <note>There is some debate regarding the direction in which the ogham text should be read due to the conflicting orientations of the text and the horses. While the explanation of <q>the horses walking in procession along the ogham band</q> is the interpretation supported by Rhys, Allen and Macalister, Forsyth is in favor of reading the ogham script right-to-left as based on the form of the recumbent Meigle 11 (1996, 6). This allows <q>both horse and ogham to go forward in opposite directions simultaneously</q> (ibid. 6). Moreover this arrangment of the text facing in, is in alignment with other seventh century Scottish gravestones.</note>

                         <p>Unfortunately, the ogham fragment is too short to yield any meaningful linguistic analysis. However, Forsyth highlights that the presence of the letter Q may suggest a variant of the formula word MAQQI. In this context, the letters MI, which follow the letter Q, could signify <q>a handful of Irish male and female personal names [that] begin Mi-</q> such as <persName>Minchloth</persName> or <persName>Midgna</persName> (1996, 9).</p>
                         <p>Despite the fragmentary state of this text, Forsyth notes that <q>it provides important evidence for the use of ogham at a major ecclesiastical site</q> (1996, 9)</p>
