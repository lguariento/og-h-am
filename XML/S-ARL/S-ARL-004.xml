                                <condition>An oddly shaped, fine-grained sandstone block which has been described previously by the RCAHMS as a <q>fragment of an inscribed pillar</q>, the <name xml:id="S-ARL-004">Loghgoilhead</name> ogham stone looks unfinished with possibly various different hands crafting each letter over periods of time. Forsyth (1996, 375) suggests that <q>perhaps the block of stone was selected for carving</q> but then <q>abandoned ending up as chisel-fodder</q>. The stone is fragmentary and damaged with the surface severely abraded at points. However as Forsyth (1996, 375) notes <q>only a small portion has been lost</q>. Interestingly, the patterns of wear suggest an eventful life with a potential of time in the sea. The begining and end of the ogham text on face C are badly worn making any reading of those portions of the inscription uncertain.

The stem-line of the ogham inscription is <height unit="mm">195 mm</height> long, running parallel to the edge of the stone. The stem appears to have been cut before and again after the cutting of the strokes, which perhaps explains why some of the strokes appear to not quite reach the stem.

The inscription has been <rs type="execution" key="chiselled" ref="https://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/writing/lod/1.html">chiselled</rs>. The carving is as Forsyth (1996, 377) observed <q>course and scrappy, doubtless because of the intractability of the stone and the subsequent abuse the block has suffered</q>. Lochgoilhead is written in a rather scruffy <q>form of the script with perpendicular b- and h- strokes and long vowel-strokes occupying between half the ogham band and all of it. The letters are not widely spaced and there is considerable variation in strokes of the same aicme</q> (Forsyth 1996, 379).

                        <provenance type="found">The stone is one of six carved stones located inside the Lochgoilhead parish church in Lochgoilhead and Kilmory. The church was first recorded at the closing of the 14th century and later sources attribute it as a dedication to the Three Holy Brethen. <q>The ogham inscripton was discovered inside the church in the early 1990s</q> yet nothing is known about when or from where it was brought into the building (Forsyth 1996, 374).

It is also quite possibe that these strokes are not connected with the ogham but <q>relate to the line of roman letters above</q> instead (Forsyth 1996, 378).</note>

                        <p>If the suggested reading is correct it could be interperted as the personal name <persName><name nymRef="#mud-mali"></name>Mud-mali</persName>. The first element may be from the adjective <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/32627">muad</ref></foreign> meaning 'noble' or 'good' while the second element may be correlated to the common personal name <persName xml:lang="sga">Magl</persName>, OIr. <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/31461">mál</ref></foreign> meaning 'prince',  which is normally found in compound names such as this one. As Forsyth (1996, 380-381) notes <q>Although there is no extant example of the two elements MOD/MUAD and MAGL-/MAL together, the combination is theoretically possible, perhaps with meaning 'noble prince'</q>.</p>
                         <p>If the fifth letter is not M as the suggested reading implies then another possibility offered by Forsyth (1996, 382) is the interpretation VALI from the root <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref>wal</ref></foreign> meaning 'to be strong', a very common element in Celtic personal names.</p>
                         <p>If letter 5 is a modified A then the potential reading Forsyth (1996, 382) purposes is Mudali, with the MU possibily serving as an abbreviation for MUCOI. It is important to note that these readings do not exhaust all possibilities. A better understanding of how the three texts (the groove, the roman and the ogham inscription) relate to one another would greatly assist in providing a more accurate interpretation.</p>
                         <p>The difficulty in defining the original purpose of the Lochgoilhead stone has led to many explanations of which, as Forsyth (1996, 383) comments one <q>is no more implausible than any other</q>.</p>
