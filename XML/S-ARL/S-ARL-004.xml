                                <condition>An oddly shaped block which has been described previously by the RCAHMS as a <q>fragment of an inscribed pillar</q>, the <name xml:id="S-ARL-004">Loghgoilhead</name> ogham stone looks unfinished with possibly various different hands crafting each letter over periods of time. Forsyth suggests that <q>perhaps the block of stone was selected for carving</q> but then <q>abandoned ending up as chisel-fodder</q> (1996, 375). The stone is fragmentary and damaged with the surface severely abraded at points. However as Forsyth notes <q>only a small portion has been lost</q> (1996, 375). Interestingly, the patterns of wear suggest a full life with a potential of time in the sea.

                                <layout>Three of the four edges and faces of the block bear evidence of carving. Edge A is plain except for a <q>deep V-section</q> groove, while edge B is incised with two lines of roman lettering. The ogham inscription is located on edge C as part of two lines of lettering to the right of another deep V-section groove. The upper inscription appears to be roman while the lower inscription is in the ogham alphabet. Edge D is the roughest out of all the surfaces and appears to be uncarved.

The individual strokes are of varying length between <height unit="cm">2.0 and 3.5</height> and <width unit="cm">0.3 and 0.6</width>. The inscription is <rs type="execution" key="carved" ref="https://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/writing/lod/168.html">carved</rs>. The carving is as Forsyth observed <q>course and scrappy, doubtless because of the intractability of the stone and the subsequent abuse the block has suffered.</q> (1996, 377). The begining and end of the inscription are badly worn making any reading of those portions uncertain.

                        <provenance type="found">The stone is one of six carved stones located inside the Lochgoilhead parish church in Lochgoilhead and Kilmory. The church was first recorded at the closing of the 14th century and later sources attribute it as a dedication to the Three Holy Brethen. <q>The ogham inscripton was discovered inside the church in the early 1990s</q> yet nothing is known about when or from where it was brought into the building (Forsyth 1996, 374).

                        <p>If the suggested reading is correct it could be interperted as the personal name MUD-MALI. The first element may be from the adjective muad meaning 'noble' or 'good' while the second element may be correlated to the common personal name MAGL which normally found in compound names such as this one. As Forsyth notes <q>Although there is no extant example of the two elements MOD/MUAD and MAGL-/MAL together, the combination is theoretically possible, perhaps with meaning 'noble prince'</q> (1996, 380-381).</p>
                         <p>If the fifth letter is not M as the suggested reading implies then another possibility offered by Forsyth is the interpretation VALI from the root wal meaning to be strong, a very common element in Celtic personal names (1996, 382).</p>
                         <p>If letter 5 is a modified A then the potential reading Forsyth purposes is the Mudali. It is important to note that these readings do not exhaust all possibilities. A better understanding in how the three texts (the groove, the roman and the ogham inscription) relate to one another would assist a more accurate interpertation.</p>
                         <p>The difficulty in defining the original purpose of the Lochgoilhead stone has led to many explanations of which, as Forsyth comments one <q>is no more implausible than any other</q> (1996, 383).</p>
