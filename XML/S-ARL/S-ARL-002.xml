As Forsyth notes the <q>surface of the opening section is almost completely worn away. There are possible traces of strokes on, or to the left of, the arris, but these are doubtful</q> (ibid.).

                                <layout style="vertical" rend="arris_up">The inscription is found along one arris of the fragment. The strokes are evenly spaced within letters, though some groups are more cramped than others, and judging from the extant fragment there is extra spacing between letters (Forsyth 1996, 449). The correct orientation is difficult to determine as both ends of the slab are missing. However, of the two possible interpretations, reading from the bottom upwards produces the most plausible reading.

In general, their proportions are long and slim with a V-shaped profile. The variation in length of stroke within each group and the manner in which individual strokes trail at the ends indicates confident cutting. The Poltalloch ogham is written with no written stem-line and vowel notches occupying no more than an eighth of the ogham band (ibid. 449).

There are indications that the site had been used in the past for ritual and burial purposes, with its earliest non-burial phase being an open-air cooking site with strong evidence of iron-working. J. Hewat Craw discovered the ogham fragment lying on the ground close to the cists in 1931. </provenance>

There is evidence for <q>two short strokes to the right of, and perpendicular to, the stem, with part of a third clearly visible</q> (Forsyth 1996, 449). However, <q>the rest has flaked off, though slight irregularities in the residual surface may be vestiges of further strokes - V, or a subsequent member of the b-aicme: S or, perhaps most likely, N</q> (Forsyth 1996, 449).</note>

Although, the principal objection to this hypothesis is linguistic, <q>one would expect the name to appear in the genitive case, CRONAIN</q> (ibid.).</note>

                        <p>The letters CRON could possibly be interpreted as the Irish name <persName xml:lang="sga">Crónán</persName>, which derives from the colour term <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/13108">crón</ref></foreign>, 'dark yellow, reddish brown, swarthy'  (Forsyth 1996, 450).</p>
                         <p>Crón is also derivative of <persName xml:lang="sga">Cróine</persName> which is the name of a number of female saints.</p>
                         <p><persName xml:lang="sga">Crónán</persName> was a common name among early Irishmen some of which had Dal Riadic connections, so <q>without a patronymic qualification there is little chance of narrowing down the list of several possible <persName xml:lang="sga">Crónán</persName>s</q> (Forsyth 1996, 450-1).</p> 
<p>If the suggested reading of the inscription is accepted, the commemorand is in fact the son of Crónán, but there is no indication at all of his own name. (Forsyth 1996, 453)</p>
