The two lines of ogham occupy almost the full length of the narrow edges of the slab. There is no evidence of any lettering along the shaped upper surface. The longer of the two lines, the right-hand side, consists of twenty-nine letters and starts parallel with the feet of the lion. The shorter side, to the left and comprising nineteen letters, begins a little higher, level with the mouth of the lion, and ends a little lower. For both inscriptions on the right and left edge, the stem is visible before the first letter so we can be sure the beginning of the text is intact. Also, all the b- and h-aicme letters slope, to a greater or lesser degree, in the direction of reading, so there can be no doubt that the ogham  inscriptions read from the bottom up as expected. </layout>

                            <handNote>The Bressay text is described by Forsyth (1996, 119) as <q>a well-carved monumental text</q>. All the strokes are sharp, narrow, V-section, <rs type="execution"  key="chiselled" ref="https://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/writing/lod/1.html">chisel-cut</rs> scores. Some are quite deep, all are well-preserved with only a very few letters being badly worn. The stem has been re-cut after the cross-strokes and is deeper and broader than them. Occasionally strokes cross the stem slightly, but never far or deeply, and these over-shoots are clearly just a slip of the blade (Forsyth 1996, 122). The letter-strokes take up the whole width of the narrow edge, i.e. the ogham-band stretches from edge to edge. All letters are clearly spaced and are evenly arranged along the entire length of the text, without bunching towards the end, indicating a degree of planning. In addition to exhibiting word division dots, rabbit-eared Ds, an angled A, a cross-hatched R, and an angular diamond shaped OI forfid, the Bressay text also features an unique character: the fifth character of the inscription on the right edge consists of five undulating strokes sloping backwards across the stem. Forsyth (1996, 127) maintains that this character is presumably a vowel and that we may take it as some form of I, perhaps an s-shaped I.

                        <provenance type="found">In the first half of the 19th century, this ogham-inscribed slab was found below ground-level near St Mary’s Church but outside the graveyard. It was taken first to Gardie House in Bressay, and thence to a churchyard about a mile to the south of Gardie House. In 1852 it was sent to Newcastle for exhibition, returned to Bressay and in 1864 presented to NMAS (ECMS pt 3: 5-6). The ogham was first published by Dr Charles Graves in 1853.

<note>The interpretation of the Bressay text remains uncertain, especially in regards to the order in which the two sides of the slab ought to be read, <q>if indeed they are meant to be taken sequentially</q> (Forsyth 1996, 129). Forsyth (1996, 127) suggests that one possible reading is to <q>take the longer line first</q>, however, <q>it could be that the two are separate sense units and it does not matter which goes first, certainly no indication is given on the inscription itself</q>. The interpretation of the longer text on the right edge is aided by the presence of word-divison dots.</note>

                <p>There are two possible translations for the inscription: 
                    <lb/>1) the cross of <persName xml:lang="xpi">Nectudad</persName>, daughter of <persName>An</persName> (in memory of her husband) <persName>Benises</persName> son of <persName>Droan</persName>
                <lb/>2) the cross of <persName xml:lang="xpi">Nectudad</persName>'s daughter <persName>An</persName>, (daughter of) <persName>Benises</persName> son of <persName>Droan</persName></p>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary">
                 <p>All have recognised the first word of the right edge inscription, CRROSCC, as meaning 'cross'. The linguisitic significance of this particular form is that it is virtually identical with the <foreign xml:lang="gd">crosg</foreign> an attested variant of the more common Modern Scottish Gaelic <foreign xml:lang="gd">crasg</foreign>, genitive <foreign xml:lang="gd">croisg</foreign> (as opposed to the Old Irish <foreign xml:lang="sga">cross</foreign>, Modern Irish <foreign xml:lang="ga">cros</foreign>. The second word, NEHHTVVDDAD̎D̎S, is most likely a Pictish personal name, <persName xml:lang="xpi">Nectudad</persName>, and judging by the ogham spellings may be related to other Pictish names such as Nechtan/Naiton, NEHT-, NEHHT-, NETU. The third word, DATTRR, has previously been understood as a form of the Old Norse <foreign xml:lang="non">dottir</foreign> 'daughter'.  Although the spelling is some way from <foreign xml:lang="non">dottir</foreign>, it might reflect a Gaelic-speaker's attempt to render a word which had been heard but not seen written (Forsyth 1996, 131). The final word, ANN, has been interpreted as the female personal name <persName>Anna</persName>. If this is a Gaelic name, it is perhaps more plausibly linked to <persName xml:lang="sga">Anu</persName> the name of a female Irish deity and saint, or the more popular <persName xml:lang="ga">Áine</persName>. It is equally possible that the name was a Norse male personal name, <persName xml:lang="non">Án(n)</persName>, gen, <persName xml:lang="non">Áns</persName>, which is mentioned in <title xml:lang="non">Landnámabók</title>.</p>
                <p>The left line of ogham contains MEQQ in the middle which immediately suggests the familiar 'X son of Y' formula. MEQQ is presumably the Irish <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/31166">mac</ref></foreign> for 'son'. The first word of the left edge inscription, BENISES, could be the personal name <persName xml:lang="non">Beinir</persName> which means 'to straighten out' and appears in Scaldic poetry meaning 'helper, giver'. Alternatively, it is possible that the initial BEN should be understood separately as the Old Irish <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/5644">ben</ref></foreign> 'woman', 'wife'. The inscription would therefore read as 'the wife of Ises son of Droan', but what BEN-ISES could mean is unclear. The final name could be Drón, genitive Dróin, a well attested Irish male personal name related to the noun <foreign xml:lang="sga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/18803">dron</ref></foreign> 'solic, firm, substantial, vigorous' </p>
                <p>According to Forsyth (1996, 137), <q>Bressay affords an insight into ninth- or early tenth-century Shetland society, commemorating a family of Christians created by inter-marriage between Norse and Celtic-speakers</q>.</p>
