                                <condition>Worked red deer antler tine, cylindrical in cross-section, with a slight curve. It is strong and sturdy but decidedly pen-shaped at one end with a notch in its nib-like tip, which helped to identify the object as a beveller, a specialist tool for trimming the edge of leather to produce a smooth result. The leather-working tools from Birsay, Orkney, now in the National Museum of Scotland, are exactly contemporary (640x860AD) and provide a handy parallel.</condition>

                            <handNote>The ogham strokes are very finely cut and are especially faint on the back (2) (the side that doesn't have the shaped tip). According to Holder's unpublished catalogue (1994, 10–11), the two inscriptions were made with different instruments. The strokes of the former are between <width>0.25–0.5</width>mm wide, whereas those of no. 2 are much finer (<width>0.1</width>mm). The vowel strokes are not short notches like on the arris of a stone, but with half-length strokes, occupying the “1/2 band” of ogham strokes (Forsyth 1996, xxxiv f., xliv-xlv). There is possible use in this inscription of one of the <foreign xml:lang="ga">forfid</foreign>, which appears as an X but not through the stem-line (like the X-<foreign xml:lang="ga">forfid</foreign> ᚕ) but to the right or below it (like the I-<foreign xml:lang="ga">forfid</foreign> ᚘ but with a single X).<height></height>

                        <provenance type="found" when="1884">Found in 1884 at the site of a crannog at Moynagh Lough (<ref target="https://www.archaeology.ie/archaeological-survey-ireland/historic-environment-viewer-application">ME005-088001-</ref>), very close to the townland (Brittas, with Moynagh and Nobber) and parish (Nobber with Castletown) boundary. Discovered by a local farmer, Owen Smith, the inscribed object was sent to Charles Graves, bishop of Limerick. A report by Graves (1888-1891) was read to the Royal Irish Academy on 24 June 1889. In the early medieval period, this was an important centre for the Airgialla population group, the Mugdorna. Dendrochronological dating of the crannog showed it was built c.625 and occupied until it was abandoned around 800AD. One of the round-houses is, at over 11m in diameter, the largest yet found in Ireland, and it has been suggested the site may have been of senior elite, or even royal, status. There is extensive evidence for deluxe metal-working and, or course, leather-working (Potterton 2022, 20-21).

It is therefore possible that this is a single X variant of the ᚘ or I-<foreign xml:lang="ga">forfid</foreign> with 'P' value. There are a few other comparable examples on stone (e.g. I-KER-102 An Chúil Thoir | Cool East 1 and W-BRE-004 Crickhowell 1), where it appears to represent a 'P' sound. It is also conceivable that it is not a letter at all, but that the X simply marks the beginning of the inscription, being functionally equivalent to a feathermark.</note></app>
