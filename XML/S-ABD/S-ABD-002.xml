                            <handNote>The ogham inscription and symbols were <rs type="execution"  key="pocked" ref="https://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/writing/lod/11.html">pocked and smoothed</rs>, a technique that is typical of Pictish Class I carvings (Forsyth 1996, 391). Strokes are generally evenly spaced and there are generous gaps between letters, though it is important to keep in mind the possibility of distortion due to the circular stem (ibid. 396). The number of strokes per letter is accepted as: 5, 3, 3, 5, 3.
                                <height>The shortest letter strokes are 3cm long, the longest are 7cm, and the remainder vary between 4 and 6cm (ibid. 393).</height>
                                <p>The carving of the symbols is <q>broader, deeper, and smoother</q> than the ogham carving, <q>but this may reflect nothing more than the larger scale of the former</q> (ibid. 391).</p>

This was one of four stones found lying on the ground on the Moor of Carden to the west of Logie Elphinstone House in or prior to about 1821. At that time the moor was planted and three of the stones were built into the enclosing wall, while the fourth (which is not known certainly to have been carved) was used as a floor slab in a kiln and <q>split by the heat and destroyed</q> (Stuart 1856, 4). The three symbol stones were subsequently removed from the wall and erected in the house grounds (Forsyth 1996, 385).

                 <p>The placement of the symbols suggests that the ogham was accounted for in the original design which further implies that the ogham relates to the same phase as the symbols, though it cannot be definitively proved. The stone is a palimpsest as there are visible remains of a partially-erased double-disc and Z-rod under the symbols; however, the overall layout strongly supports the assumption that the ogham relates to the second phase (Forsyth 1996, 391-2).</p>
                     <p>Logie is the shortest complete monumental ogham text in Scotland (Forsyth 1996, 398) and as such cannot be readily interpreted. According to Forsyth, the lack of vowels <q>strongly suggests that the sequence is either encoded, or has no linguistic significance</q> (ibid).</p>
