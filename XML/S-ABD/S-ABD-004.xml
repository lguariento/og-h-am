According to Gordon's description, both the symbols and the ogham inscription were <q>improved to such an extent that its shallow grooves are smooth and regular, contrasting clearly with the flat but roughish surface of the boulder</q> (ibid).  The stem-line is 30 mm across at the surface, but only 10 mm at the bottom of the channel (Forsyth 1996, 105). The letters are slighter, an average 25 mm at the surface and 5 mm at the base (ibid. 109), with a tendency towards diminution. The individual letter strokes are very evenly and closely spaced, although <q>a gap sufficient to take a stroke has been left</q> to distinguish successive letters of the same aicme (ibid. 111).

                        <note>While the transliteration of the ogham inscription is unambiguous, the interpretation remains uncertain. The most likely interpretation is a single personal name, taking into consideration the length of the text. However, it is uncertain whether the thirteen letters are a complete text as they are, or whether there are any letters missing from the end (Forsyth 1996, 112-3).</note>

                        <note>Thomas Clancy proposed to segment the text as follows:</note>

            <div type="translation" xml:lang="en">
                <p>Clancy suggested an Old Irish interpretation of the text 'i rath Aduarén s-' of which the most likely translation is: 'this is the property of Adúarén’.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary">
<p>The original orientation of the stone is assumed to have been vertical. Given that the ogham inscription is situated vertically relative to the intact sides of the stone, it is further assumed that the original orientation of the inscription was vertical as well despite its current diagonal axis (Forsyth 1996, 104). Forsyth noted that precise measurements of the stone are difficult to obtain given its irregular shape (ibid. 103-4).</p>
                <p>The ogham text and Pictish symbols are contemporary, but whether their messages are separate, equivalent or complimentary remains to be established. The inscription is on the same scale as the symbols and is given equal prominence (ibid. 115).</p>
                <p>Clancy notes that Aduar is an attested male personal name [Annals of Innisfallen 810, CGH], of which Aduarán or Aduarén would be 'plausible diminutives' [pers. comm.]. Uhlich interprets Aduar as a compound of the intensifying prefix <foreign xml:lang="ga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/247">ad</ref></foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="ga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/42762">uar</ref></foreign>, meaning 'very cold’ (ibid. 114). While <foreign xml:lang="ga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/34834">rath</ref></foreign> usually refers to moveable wealth, 'property', 'fief, may be the meaning here, or perhaps <foreign xml:lang="ga"><ref target="https://dil.ie/34833">rath</ref></foreign> as in 'gift', 'something bestowed'.</p>
