                                <condition>The inscribed stone is an irregular, ridged pillar complete with a well preserved carving, though the final portion of the longer text has been defaced (Forsyth 1996, 424, 426). 
                                    <p>The symbol stone is of the same material and <q>very similar in general appearance to the inscribed stone</q> (ibid. 439).</p>

                                <layout>There are six lines of seemingly Roman alphabetic characters at the top right of the pillar and an ogham inscription runs on the left-hand edge, consisting of a longer <dimensions unit="cm" quantity="14.5"><height>(14.5 cm)</height></dimensions> and a shorter <dimensions unit="cm" quantity="5"><height>(5cm)</height></dimensions> section and reading from the top down (Forsyth 1996, 424-6). The shorter section of ogham script has a drawn-in stem <q>inserted between the distal tips of the first two strokes of</q> the 20th letter (ibid. 430).  After the 20th letter, the drawn-in stem curves sharply to the left and then continues straight up, parallel to the initial hypothetical stem (ibid). 
                                    <lb/>The symbol stone, which accompanies the inscribed stone, features two symbols, <q>a double-disc (without Z-rod) and a serpent-and-Z-rod</q>, which are <q>medially placed one above the other in the typical Class I symbol statement form</q> (ibid. 440). <q>The double-disc consists of a pair of two concentric rings, each with a central dot, linked by a very thin curving bridge, also with inner lines parallel to the outer.</q> According to Forsyth (ibid. 440), the Newton stone is the only example of a single notched double-disc: <q>the bite missing from the bottom of the left-hand disc, the inner line shadows this notch</q>. Similarly, the stone's <q>serpent-and-Z-rod symbol is not common, occurring on only five Class I stones</q> (ibid).

                            <handNote>The ogham strokes appear to have been <rs type="execution"  key="pocked" ref="https://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/writing/lod/11.html">pocked</rs> and subsequently smoothed (Gordon 1956, 41). From the 14th letter onwards, the inscription is more tightly packed but there are clear gaps between all the ogham letters throughout (Forsyth 1996, 426, 430). Forsyth further notes that <q>the vowel strokes are rather long, at least as long as, if not longer than, b- and h- aicme stokes and almost as long as some m-aicme</q> (ibid). 
                                <height>An average of 4-6cm for the longer section, and for the shorter section, an average of 7.5cm for long strokes and 5cm for short strokes (ibid. 425).</height>
                                <p>The nearby symbol stone has been carved <q>using the same basic technique as</q> the inscribed stone (ibid. 430). Gordon described the lines of the symbol stone as <q>deeply and roughly pocked</q> and, on average, a few millimetres broader than the inscribed stone's letters (1956, 43).</p>

In 1873, both the inscribed stone and symbol stone were moved again and positioned side by side on the lawn of Newton house.

                <app n="1"><note>The ogham and non-ogham inscriptions are not transliterations of each other and do not seem to correspond with any section of the other (Forsyth 1996, 425). The non-ogham inscription was initially believed to be a forgery from the early nineteenth century, but Gordon disproved this in his study, showing that the two had indeed been carved by different hands but used a similar technique (Gordon 1956, 41, 44).</note>                    
                </app>
                    <app n="2"><note>It is unclear whether the defaced portion of the longer ogham section is repeated at the start of the drawn stem-line. The shorter section could be a correction or an alteration, but it seems more likely that it is a continuation of the longer section (Forsyth 1996, 426).</note>
                    </app>
                    <app n="3"><note>While unusual, reading the ogham inscription from the top down (left-to-right with the head to the right) is more feasible because it provides a more intelligible reading and would also explain the curving of the shorter section at the bottom of the stone (Forsyth 1996, 427). If the inscription had started at the bottom, the inscription could have progressed upwards and could have continued across the top of the stone and down if more space was needed, as is the case for certain Irish stones (ibid).</note>

            <div type="commentary">
                    <p>Given the uncertainty of the final section of the inscription, it is not possible to assuredly determine its syntax and in extension its meaning. Nevertheless, Forsyth (1996, 436) suggests three possibilities:<lb/>
                        <lb/> 1) three personal names with no formula words: 'Idamon (, or :) Vorenn (and) [?]'
                        <lb/>2) three names plus KOI: 'Idamon: Vorenn koi [?]'  
                        <lb/>3) three names plus ipe: either 'X, Y ipe Z ', or 'X, Y, ipe-Z'.</p>
                     <p><q>As for the two sections of ogham, the longer clearly predates, though not necessarily by much, the shorter</q> (ibid. 426). Without an improved understanding of the text, it is not possible to determine the date of origin accurately. It could be dated anywhere between the sixth or eighth century, though more likely in the seventh century and earlier given the subsequent decline of the individual inscribed memorial as a monument type throughout the British Isles (ibid. 441). </p>
